Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone.,0,76
I'm using it with an iriver SPINN (with case) and it fits fine.,1,63
Also the area where my unit broke).- I'm not too fond of the magnetic strap.,0,76
"Overall, I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception.",1,109
"every thing on phone work perfectly, she like it.",1,49
"Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland, especially in the all black model.",0,115
IT'S REALLY EASY.,1,17
My Sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect.,1,69
Fantastic earphones.,1,20
It finds my cell phone right away when I enter the car.,1,55
Low Quality.,0,12
I highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone.,1,53
But it does get better reception and clarity than any phone I've had before.,1,76
Warning - Stay away.,0,20
I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.,0,53
Awsome Device Works Great!!.,1,28
I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.,0,94
"If you don't find it, too bad, as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone.",0,113
Very Displeased.,0,16
"I might have gotten a defect, but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone.",0,102
They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.,0,63
Restored my phone to like new performance.,1,42
"I would recommend purchasing the Jabra JX-10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my Moto Q, go figure.",1,103
"I searched the Internet, and found this one to be the best value.",1,65
Does not fit.,0,13

There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset.,0,56
"i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it wasn't high priced.",1,82
Portable and it works.,1,22
"My colleague & I now get great reception.A little expensive, but performance is great.",1,86
I even fully charged it before I went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wi-fi and noticed that it only had 20 % left in the morning.,0,135
I've also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again.,0,110
Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.,0,42
Timely shipment and quality product.,1,36
Nice solid keyboard.,1,20
Very well made and fits my Surefire GX2 perfectly.,1,50
Horrible phone.,0,15
BT50 battery junk!.,0,19

Disappointed!.,0,14
poor voice clarity.,0,19
The battery works great!,1,24
No buyers remorse on this one!.,0,31
Very disappointed in AccessoryOne.,0,34
I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers.,0,99
"Looks great and is strong.""",1,27
"I have had TMobile service for 2 or 3 years now, and I am pretty happy with it.",1,79
The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.,0,49
Disappointment.. I hate anything that goes in my ear.,0,53
Great software for Motorolas.,1,29
The delivery was on time.,1,25
Very easy to use.,1,17
"Uncomfortable In the Ear, Don't use with LG VX9900 (EnV).",0,57
The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.,0,68
"It holds a charge for a long time, is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous.",1,130
I'd like to return it.,0,22
The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems.,1,97
"Verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple.",0,97
"After charging overnight, these batteries work great.",1,53
You won't regret it!,1,20
I love this phone!.,1,19
A Disappointment.,0,17
Its not user friendly.,0,22
Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.,0,140
"Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem.",0,68
This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.,0,67
This PDA rocks.,1,15
"It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles.",1,101
"I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price!",1,111
I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.,1,57
Pretty piece of junk.,0,21
Plug was the wrong size.,0,24
Works as described.,1,19
Save your money.... I've had this item for 11 months now.,0,57
Bad Purchase.,0,13
WELL IM SATISFIED.,1,18
"The bose noise cancelling is amazing, which is very important for a NYC commuter.",1,81
This battery is an excellent bargain!,1,37
Defective crap.,0,15
I would have given no star if I was able.,0,41
I wear glasses and it fits fine with them.,1,42
"The sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area, you almost hear nothing.",0,112
I would not recommend this item to anyone.,0,42
The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.,0,59
great...no problems at all!.,1,28
"As an earlier review noted, plug in this charger and nothing happens.",0,69
This frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching.,1,56
You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.,0,106
The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.,1,80
I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far.,1,116
"very good product, well made.",1,29
Mobile Phone Tools are a must have.,1,35
I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.,1,83
"I received my orders well within the shipping timeframe, everything was in good working order and overall, I am very excited to have this source.",1,145
The phone is sturdy and waterproof.,1,35
I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.,0,75
My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5(of 5),0,93
Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price!,1,69
I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.,1,70
I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great.,1,75
Works great!.,1,13
REALLY UGLY.,0,12
"horrible, had to switch 3 times.",0,32
The noise shield is incrediable.,1,32
No real improvement.,0,20
Razr Battery - Good buy.,1,24
Keep up the good work Amazon!!,1,30
They refuse to refund or replace.,0,33
Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.,0,149
So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.,0,57
Great case and price!,1,21
All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.,0,131
"Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.",1,128
"Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place.",1,78
The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.,1,103
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.,0,53
I am glad I purchased it.,1,25
I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.,0,50
"Perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when I use this.",0,73
Don't buy this product.,0,23
"sucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone.",0,54
"No shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid.",1,123
Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.,0,69
Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.,0,61
The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.,0,85
"I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.",1,111
"I love the camera, it's really pretty good quality.",1,51
Thank you for such great service.,1,33
Its a total package.,1,20
"The seller is very understanding and patient, I would definitely buy from them again.",1,85
I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.,0,85
It's AGGRAVATING!,0,17
Great product for the price!.,1,29
"I have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use",1,95
Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!,1,58
"None of it works, just don't buy it.",0,36
"Muddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off.",0,102
Please dont waste your money.,0,29
"All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase.",1,51
"If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it.",0,83
Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.,0,65
Disapointing Results.,0,21
Cumbersome design.,0,18
"Great it was new packaged nice works good, no problems and it came in less time then I expected!!!!",1,99
Great Product.,1,14
It's A PIECE OF CRAP!,0,21

This fixes all the problems.,1,28
Worst ever.,0,11
I am very happy,1,15
"I've had no trouble accessing the Internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.",1,101
"I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying ""what?""",0,61
The battery life is highly unacceptable.,0,40
That company is a joke.,0,23
It does everything the description said it would.,1,49
Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.,0,76
"It works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.",1,98
"Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data.",0,144
"Voice Quality, Signal Strength, Dropped Calls.",0,46
"It plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it's not.",1,137
Better than expected.,1,21
"It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.",0,132
Battery is holding up well.,1,27
Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.,0,61
"I only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with.",0,64
I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.,0,117
Sprint - terrible customer service.,0,35
Linked to my phone without effort.,1,34
THey are so cool!,1,17
Easy to use.,1,12
Better Than New.,1,16
"What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea...",0,52
Piece of trash.,0,15
A pretty good product.,1,22
This is a great phone!.,1,23
"For the price on Amazon, it is an excellent product, which I would highly recommend.",1,84
Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.,1,75
"The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.",0,57
Those phones are working just fine now.,1,39
I am more than happy with this product.,1,39
Poor Construction.,0,18
This is infuriating.,0,20
"Overall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.",1,59
Sprint charges for this service.,0,32
"It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.",0,48
It fits my ear well and is comfortable on.,1,42
It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.,0,34
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.,1,87
I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.,1,134
I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.,1,113
the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.,0,99
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.,0,82
Poor product.,0,13
However I needed some better instructions.,0,42
You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.,0,124
Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver).,1,109
"Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack.",0,103
DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS,0,29
This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.,1,60
"Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.",0,67
All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.,1,116
Very Dissapointing Performance.,0,31
Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone.,0,71
This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand.,0,62
Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.,0,104
I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.,1,85
Don't bother - go to the store.,0,31
"I posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the Fire Red and it's a great color!",1,110
I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.,1,77
You get what you pay for I guess.,0,33
"Not only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection.",1,137
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.,1,86
These are fabulous!,1,19
"However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.",0,126
I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.,1,126
Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.,0,49
"Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.",0,104
Very wind-resistant.,1,20
"Obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for.",0,77
"They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.",1,135
"I contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck.",0,142
Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!,0,84
Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.,1,44
Great phone.,1,12
"When I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides.",0,110
I'm pleased.,1,12
Battery is terrible.,0,20
I found the product to be easy to set up and use.,1,49
The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.,0,80
Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.,0,39
"The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work.",0,71
"No ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is great.",1,53
"Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.",0,112
"The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.",1,144
Talk about USELESS customer service.,0,36
"It felt too light and ""tinny."".",0,31
This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.,0,89
I'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.,1,58
I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones.,1,47
Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.,1,66
Does everything it should and more.,1,35
I could not recommend these more.,0,33
Nice Sound.,1,11
"Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!",0,68
Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.,1,58
Setup went very smoothly.,1,25
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.,0,60
"A must study for anyone interested in the ""worst sins"" of industrial design.",0,76
The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.,0,60
"It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.",1,80
Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.,0,78
Can't upload ringtones from a third party.,0,42
"Bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.",0,126
Truly awful.,0,12
"It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.",1,91
The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).,1,67
And none of the tones is acceptable.,0,36
camera color balance is AWFUL.,0,30
"This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.",0,135
I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!,1,48
Chinese Forgeries Abound!.,0,26
Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.,1,34
The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.,0,69
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.,0,67
Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!,0,58
Works well.,1,11
The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.,0,53
Clear crisp sound.,1,18
"I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well.",1,75
"The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast.",0,62
The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.,0,85
Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.,0,42
The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.,1,60
It doesn't make you look cool.,0,30
"Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all.",1,69
"Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.",1,115
"Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.",0,107
You can't beat the price on these.,1,34
"* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously!",1,114
lightweight and works well.,1,27
So just beware.,0,15
I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.,1,73
So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.,0,55
This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.,1,96
I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.,0,80
Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.,1,87
Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.,0,46
"It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.",0,115
Poor quality.,0,13
"jabra ear gels ""R"" the best!.",1,29
Not worth it.,0,13
The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.,0,63
"It quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned.",1,136
"Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc).",0,142
It was a great phone.,1,21
if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.,0,99
"Good value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet.",1,60
My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.,1,101
This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!,1,60
Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!,0,84
"In the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim ""Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?",1,87
I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.,1,85
"This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional.",1,95
"Other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape.",1,111
It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.,1,53
After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.,0,63
This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.,1,114
None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.,0,73
T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.,1,48
Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.,1,63
We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros,0,65
"Provides good protection and looks classy, too.",1,47
Krussel Always good.,1,20

The design is very good.4.,1,26
I great reception all the time.,1,31

"stay away from this store, be careful.",0,38
This BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.,1,60
Does not fit.,0,13
.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.,1,126
"It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.",1,115
disappointing.,0,14
Blue Ant is easy to use.,1,24
Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.,1,81
The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.,0,108
Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.,0,77
It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.,1,93
The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.,0,43
The sound quality is excellent as well.,1,39
Its the best headset I have used.,1,33
Would not reccommend.,0,21
They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date.,1,121
Just what I wanted.,1,19
This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.,0,67
wont work right or atleast for me.,0,34
in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.,0,82
"But now that it is ""out of warranty"" the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it.",0,141
"I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one, but it has too many issues for me.The good",0,99

Great bluetooth!.,1,17
I highly recommend this case.,1,29
WORTHWHILE.,1,11
This is a great deal.,1,21
"After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.",0,98
I am sorry I made this purchase.,0,32
I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.,0,111
Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.,0,118
It was horrible!.,0,17
I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.,0,56
This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.,0,89
They work about 2 weeks then break.,0,35
It is simple to use and I like it.,1,34
"It's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!",1,147
I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.,0,54
NOT WHAT I WANTED.,0,18
I own 2 of these cases and would order another.,1,47
Great Phone.,1,12
I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase.,1,84
"The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked.",0,66
Perfect for the PS3.,1,20
"Five star Plus, plus.",1,21
A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me.,1,141
$50 Down the drain.,0,19
I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great.,0,102
"Good , works fine.",1,18
For the price this was a great deal.,1,36
"Great price, too!",1,17
"If there is a wind, it is completely useless.",0,45
